The currently available default elements: `parallax`, `google maps`,  `pricing table`, `features boxes`, `testimonials carousel`, `team`, `list of clients`, `accordion`, `tabs`, `author card`, `contact form` and `portfolio`.

== Installation ==

1. After activating your theme, you can see a prompt pointed out as absolutely critical. Go to "Appearance -> Install Plugins".
Or, upload the plugin to wordpress, Activate it. (Access the path (/wp-content/plugins/) And upload files there.)


2. Create a new WordPress file or edit an existing one. Just make sure to select this new created template file as the "Template" for this page from the "Attributes" section. Enter page title like "Custom One Page". Save the page and hit "Preview" to see how it looks. ( You could specify the template name, in this case I used **"Uix Page Builder Template"**. )


> You could create Uix Page Builder template file (from the directory **"/wp-content/plugins/uix-page-builder/theme_templates/page-uix_page_builder.php"** ) in your templates directory.


You will find **"Uix Page Builder Attributes"** settings in a meta box in your WordPress backend when you create a new page or when you are editing an existing one. This box is usually directly above the "Publish" meta box.
